/**
 * @title Filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with ETH.
 * Pricing is achieved using an automated Dutch-auction mechanism, with a
 * settlement mechanism for tokens purchased before the auction ends.
 * Allows for discounted minting and using excess funds to mint more tokens.
 * This is designed to be used with GenArt721CoreContractV3 flagship or
 * engine contracts.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the core contract's Admin
 * ACL contract and a project's artist. Both of these roles hold extensive
 * power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * Additionally, the purchaser of a token has some trust assumptions regarding
 * settlement, beyond typical minter Art Blocks trust assumptions. In general,
 * Artists and Admin are trusted to not abuse their powers in a way that
 * would artifically inflate the sellout price of a project. They are
 * incentivized to not do so, as it would diminish their reputation and
 * ability to sell future projects. Agreements between Admin and Artist
 * may or may not be in place to further dissuade artificial inflation of an
 * auction's sellout price.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the core contract's Admin ACL
 * contract:
 * - setAllowablePriceDecayHalfLifeRangeSeconds (note: this range is only
 *   enforced when creating new auctions)
 * - resetAuctionDetails (note: this will prevent minting until a new auction
 *   is created)
 * - adminEmergencyReduceSelloutPrice
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist or the core
 * contract's Admin ACL contract:
 * - withdrawArtistAndAdminRevenues (note: this may only be called after an
 *   auction has sold out or has reached base price)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - setAuctionDetails (note: this may only be called when there is no active
 *   auction, and must start at a price less than or equal to any previously
 *   made purchases)
 * - setProjectMaxInvocations
 * - manuallyLimitProjectMaxInvocations
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 *
 * @dev Note that while this minter makes use of `block.timestamp` and it is
 * technically possible that this value is manipulated by block producers via
 * denial of service (in PoS), such manipulation will not have material impact
 * on the price values of this minter given the business practices for how
 * pricing is congfigured for this minter and that variations on the order of
 * less than a minute should not meaningfully impact price given the minimum
 * allowable price decay rate that this minter intends to support.
